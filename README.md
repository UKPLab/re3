# Re3: A Holistic Framework and Dataset for Modeling Collaborative Document Revision
This repository will host Re3: A Holistic Framework and Dataset for Modeling Collaborative Document Revision, to be presented at ACL-2024. The dataset will appear here shortly.

## Abstract: 
Collaborative review and revision of textual documents is the core of knowledge work and a promising target for empirical analysis and NLP assistance. Yet, a holistic framework that would allow modeling complex relationships between document revisions, reviews and author responses is lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Re3, a framework for joint analysis of collaborative document revision. We instantiate this framework in the scholarly domain, and present Re3-Sci, a large corpus of aligned scientific paper revisions manually labeled according to their action and intent, and supplemented with the respective peer reviews and human-written edit summaries. We use the new data to provide first empirical insights into collaborative document revision in the academic domain, and to assess the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs at automating edit analysis and facilitating text-based collaboration. We make our annotation environment and protocols, the resulting data and experimental code publicly available.

*Figure 1. Re3 offers a holistic framework for studying the relationships between reviews (a), revisions (b-c) and responses (d) in text-based collaboration. It is instantiated in the Re3-Sci dataset that covers all edits in 314 full-length scientific publications manually labeled with edit action and intent (e) on different granularity levels, along with reviews that trigger edits and manually curated responses that summarize all edits made including self-initiated ones (f).*
